   - Recommended VPS size at least 1gb RAM 
   - **It must be Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)**
2. Make sure you have a transaction of exactly 1000 POLIS in your desktop cold wallet.

2. Go to the "Tools" -> "Debug console"
3. Run the following command: `masternode genkey`
4. You should see a long key that looks like:
```
3HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg
```
5. This is your `private key`, keep it safe, do not share with anyone.




## VPS Setup

1. Log into your VPS
   - Windows users [follow this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-log-into-your-droplet-with-putty-for-windows-users) to log into your VPS.
2. Copy/paste command into the VPS and hit enter: (For this step you will need your `private key` 
   generated at step 5 above and your VPS IP address)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalmine/Guide/master/install_masternode.sh && chmod +x install_masternode.sh && ./install_masternode.sh
```
3. When prompted, enter your private key from before.
4. You will be asked for your VPS IP and a few other questions.
5. The installation should finish successfully. 
6. Copy command to source alias
```
source ~/.bash_aliases
```
Your poliscore (`polisd`) should be up and running by now.
7.Use `polis-cli getinfo` to check and wait til it's synced 
  (look for blocks number and compare with block explorer http://explorer.polispay.org/insight/ )


## Cold Wallet Setup Part 2 

1. On your local machine open your `masternode.conf` file.
   Depending on your operating system you will find it in:
   * Windows: `%APPDATA%\polisCore\`
   * Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/polisCore/`
   * Unix/Linux: `~/.poliscore/`
   
   Leave the file open
2. Go to "Tools" -> "Debug console"
3. Run the following command: `masternode outputs`
4. You should see output like the following if you have a transaction with exactly 1000 POLIS:
```
{
    "12345678xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx": "0"
}
```
5. The value on the left is your `txid` and the right is the `vout`
6. Add a line to the bottom of the already opened `masternode.conf` file using the IP of your
VPS (with port 24126), `private key`, `txid` and `vout`:
```
mn1 1.2.3.4:24126 3xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 12345678xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 0 
```
7. Save the file, exit your wallet and reopen your wallet.
8. Go to the "Masternodes" tab
9. Click "Start All"
10. You will see "WATCHDOG_EXPIRED". Just wait few minutes
